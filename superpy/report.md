The Superpy program is designed to help businesses manage their inventory by tracking products, purchases, and sales. It features three main highlights, which are:

Buying products
Selling products
Generating a profit report
Let's take a closer look at these features and the problems they solve:

Buying products
The buy function allows users to add new products to their inventory by specifying the product ID, name, start date, cost, and expiration date. The function accepts these parameters through the command line using argparse, and then creates a new row in a CSV file to store the product information. The CSV file is formatted so that each row represents a unique purchase, making it easy to track inventory levels and expiration dates.

By providing an automated way to track inventory, the buy function solves the problem of manual data entry errors that can lead to inaccurate inventory counts and expired products. It also enables users to quickly add new products to their inventory and monitor their status without having to perform manual calculations.

Selling products
The sell function allows users to remove products from their inventory by specifying the product ID of the item they wish to sell. The program then searches the CSV file for matching product IDs and identifies the item with the earliest expiration date. If there are multiple items with the same expiration date, it will sell the one that was bought first. The program then updates the CSV file to reflect the sale and adjusts the inventory count accordingly.

This feature solves the problem of manually tracking inventory levels and expiration dates, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. By automating the process, the program reduces the risk of selling expired products and enables users to make informed decisions about which products to sell first based on their expiration dates.

Generating a profit report
The profit_report function generates a report of the profits earned from product sales within a specified time frame. Users can specify whether they want to view profits for the current day, the previous day, the current week, the previous week, or the current month. The function reads data from a CSV file containing sales information and calculates the total profit earned during the specified time frame.

This feature solves the problem of manually calculating profits and provides users with an easy way to track their revenue over time. It also enables users to identify trends in sales and adjust their inventory levels accordingly, which can help them optimize their business operations and increase profitability.

In conclusion, the Superpy program provides a comprehensive solution for businesses looking to manage their inventory more effectively. Its features enable users to track inventory levels, expiration dates, and profits with ease, reducing the risk of errors and streamlining operations.
