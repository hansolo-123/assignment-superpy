This Python program is a command-line interface for managing product buying, selling, and profit reporting. The program is divided into three main functions:

buy: Allows the user to log a product purchase into a CSV file.
sell: Allows the user to sell a product and update the stock and sales CSV files.
profit_report: Allows the user to generate a profit report based on a specified time period (today, yesterday, this-week, last-week, this-month, or last-month).
The program uses several modules such as argparse, csv, datetime, sys, rich.console, and rich.table. The program is built to follow specific command-line arguments to execute the intended function. Here are the command-line arguments for each function:

buy: buy --id <product_id> --product <product_name> --cost <price> --start_datetime <start_date> --end_datetime <expiration_date>. All arguments are mandatory.

sell: sell --id <product_id>. The product ID argument is mandatory.

profit_report: profit_report --date <time_period>. The date argument is optional, but if specified, the value should be one of today, yesterday, this-week, last-week, this-month, or last-month.

Here's an example of how the program can be used to log a product purchase:

python superpy.py buy --id 123 --product 'Milk' --cost 1.50 --start_datetime '2023-03-14' --end_datetime '2023-03-17'
This command will log a product purchase with ID 123, product name Milk, price 1.50, start date 2023-03-14, and expiration date 2023-03-17.

Here's an example of how the program can be used to sell a product:

python superpy.py sell --id 123
This command will sell a product with ID 123.

Here's an example of how the program can be used to generate a profit report:

python superpy.py profit_report --date today
This command will generate a profit report for today's date.
